# First project_Machine Learning

## Name: Final Project - The Awesome Bank Marketing Campaign

## Description

This project was my final project from my Post Graduate Degree in Data Science's Unit of Study Machine Learning Fundamentals. I got the grade of 19 in 20 in this project, finalizing also the Unit of Study Machine Learning Fundamentals with the final grade of 19 in 20. The project that I present here incorporates some improvings pointed by the Professor. 

This project is about the following busness problem (kaggle's challenge):

After your success in the first project at The Awesome Bank, an even more exciting new project appears!

The marketing team wants to launch a new campaign aimed at convincing customers to open term deposits.

Until now, the strategy was to call as many people as possible, indiscriminately, and try to sell them the product. However, this approach, in addition to spending more resources because it involves having several people calling all customers, is also uncomfortable for some customers who do not like to be disturbed by this type of call. After the calculations, it was concluded that:

    - For each customer identified as a good candidate, and is the target of the campaign but does not adhere to the term deposit, the bank has a cost of 500 euros.
    - For each customer who is identified as a candidate, and as such is not the target of the campaign but was actually a good candidate and would join, the bank has a cost of 2000 euros.

The goal of this project was to based on this information, help the marketing team by creating a model that selects the best candidates to be targeted by the campaign, in order to reduce costs. 


## Other projects

In this repository I also added two more projects named - `Machine-Learning_group-project` and `Exploratory-Data-Analysis_first-project` - where I share a little more my skills as a data scientist, the project `Machine-Learning_group-project` was developed with two more collegues from my course. 
- `Machine-Learning_group-project` focused in feature engineering mostly, manipulating in json. 
- `Exploratory-Data-Analysis_first-project` - focused mostly in data visualization and exploratory data analysis. 


## Authors and acknowledgment
I must thank my professors and my collegues whom helped me so much on my evolution as a problem-thinker, which contributed so much for the development of this project and its success, as my first machine learning project.
